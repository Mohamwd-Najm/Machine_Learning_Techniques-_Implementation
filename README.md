<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Mohamed Najm</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Data analysist from Egypt</h3>

- I’m currently working on [Machine Learning ##tichnices## course (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## What I want to say

**VERBOSE CONTENT WARNING: YOU CAN JUMP TO THE NEXT SECTION IF YOU WANT**

As a CS major student and a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity and Udemy etc... I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. Here I released these solutions, which are **only for your reference purpose**. So, Here the Programming Assignments for the first three courses of new version of the specialization. It may help you to save some time. And I hope you don't copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully).

- Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

  - There is no PA for this course. But this course comes with two very interesting case study quizzes.


## Milestones

  - **2021-07-15**: Finished the first-released 3 courses!
