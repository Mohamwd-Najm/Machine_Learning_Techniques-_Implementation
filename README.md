- Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning Techniques Implementation as you can see on this repo.

## Introduction

ML Techniques are important topics to learn and implement so, I did that.


## What I want to say

**VERBOSE CONTENT WARNING: YOU CAN JUMP TO THE NEXT SECTION IF YOU WANT**

As a CS major student and a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity and Udemy etc... I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. Here I released these solutions, which are **only for your reference purpose**. So, Here the Programming Assignments for the first three courses of new version of the specialization. It may help you to save some time. And I hope you don't copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully).

- Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

  - There is no PA for this course. But this course comes with two very interesting case study quizzes.


## Milestones

  - **2021-07-15**: Finished the first-released 3 courses!
