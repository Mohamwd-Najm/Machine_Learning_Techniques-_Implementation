<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Mohamed Najm</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Data analysist from Egypt</h3>

- Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning Techniques Implementation as you can see on this repo.

## Introduction

ML Techniques are important topics to learn and implement so, I did that. Here you will found all the notebooks and all the datasets which have used. 


## What I want to say

AS a beginner in ML you always find implementing of all this techniques difficult. As a passionate Data analysist and a long-time self-taught learner. I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. Here I released these solutions, It may help you to save some time. And I hope you implement they by yourself not just copy any part of the code.

## Machine Learning Techniques Implementation

 - Here you will found implementation for those topics: 
  
  - [ Linear Regression](https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
  - [ Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
  - [ Decision Trees and Random Forest]( https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Implementation.ipynb)
  - [ K Means Clustering](https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/K%20Means%20Clustering%20Implementation%20.ipynb)
  - [ K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb)
  - [ SVM](https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/SVM.ipynb)
  - [ PCA](https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/PCA%20Implementation.ipynb)
  
  And there are 3 revelant notebooks which are an implementation either but for NLP consepts and a simple Recomendation system.
  ### First, NLP:
  #### Part 1
  - [NLP (Natural Language Processing) Implementation](https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/NLP%20(Natural%20Language%20Processing)%20Implementation.ipynb)
     - In this notebook we will discuss a higher level overview of the basics of Natural Language Processing, which basically consists of combining machine learning techniques with text, and using math and statistics to get that text in a format that the machine learning algorithms can understand!
then apply that on SMSSpamCollection dataset to predict if the massage ham or spam.
 
 #### Part 2
  - [NLP - Natural Language Processing Implementation 2](https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/02%20NLP%20Implementation.ipynb)
     - In this NLP project you will be attempting to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews. we will utilize the pipeline methods for more complex tasks.
We will use the Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle.

 ### Secand, Recommender System.
  - [Recommender Systems Implementation](https://github.com/Mohamwd-Najm/Machine_Learning_Techniques_Implementation/blob/main/Recommender%20Systems%20Implementation.ipynb)
    - In this notebook, we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. Keep in mind, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately,it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.
